* [Installation](#installation)
* [Quick Start / Tutorial](#quick-start)
    + [Run translation alone](#run-translation)
    + [Run segmentation alone](#run-segmentation)  
    + [Choice of pretext task](#choice-of-pretext-task)

## Installation

[//]: # (An Nvidia GPU is needed for faster inference &#40;less than 1 sec/scan on 1080ti gpu&#41;.)

Requirements:

* torch == 1.3
* numpy == 1.16
* SimpleITK == 2.0
* opencv-python == 4.1

[//]: # (* scikit-image == 0.16.2)


Install dependencies:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/yu02019/MouseGAN-pp.git
cd MouseGAN-pp
pip install -r requirement.txt
```



## Run translation
For multi-modality dataset:

```shell
python translation.py --dataroot DATAROOT --name NAME --num_domains NUM_DOMAINS --out_dir OUT_DIR --resume MODEL_DIR --num NUM_PER_IMG
```


## Run segmentation
For example, run on MRM NeAt dataset:

[//]: # (todo)
```shell
python segmentation.py -i input_folder -o output_folder -w model_weight 
```

## Choice of pretext task

In our paper, we used modality translation as our pretext task, as we wanted to impute missing modality. However, if readers are faced with multi-center single modality data (e.g, T2w MR images from 11.7T and 9.4T scanners), our pretext task could change to center-style translation easily.

## Plan list

## Dataset release / Pretrained weight / Contributing to MouseGAN++

We will release our multi-modality MR mouse dataset images for more extensive communities for both neuroscience and deep learning.

The details can be found in this [folder](/dataset_release).
