# Translation module

The building blocks of translation module are derived from [DRIT](https://github.com/HsinYingLee/DRIT).

The choice of pretext task for contrastive learning is flexible (see [here](https://github.com/yu02019/MouseGAN-pp#choice-of-pretext-task)).
The selection of hyper-parameters are reported [here](https://github.com/yu02019/MouseGAN-pp/tree/main/demo#hyper-parameter).
[Pretrained weight](https://github.com/yu02019/MouseGAN-pp/tree/main/demo#pretrained-weight) is also provided.
